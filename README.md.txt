The script run-analysis.R takes raw data from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and returns a tidy data set. 

The script includes the following files:

- README.txt
- Codebook.txt
- run_analysis.R

**To properly run run_analysis.R, the data must be found in the working directory.** 
The data can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The script run_analysis.R reads data from the following files:

- features_info.txt
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- train/X_train.txt
- train/y_train.txt
- test/X_test.txt
- test/y_test.txt

More information on the creation of the tidy data set can be found in the CodeBook
